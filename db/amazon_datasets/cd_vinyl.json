Students are taught using the \"\"mother-tongue\"\" approach. This CD contains the repertoire from <I>Suzuki Piano School</I> Volumeumes 1 & 2. Because much of the Suzuki approach is based on listening and ear training, the recording is an essential component for the student's success. <br><br>Recording artist William Aide, Professor Emeritus, Rupert E.
