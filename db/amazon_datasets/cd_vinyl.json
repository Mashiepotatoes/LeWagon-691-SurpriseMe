Four teenagers out for an evening of fun on the boardwalk take a ride on the ''Wild Wheel'' (an antique carousel with a shadowy past) and learn too late that decisions made in an instant can have deadly consequences. What begins as a night of innocent end-of-summer revelry, young love, and (a few too many) beers among friends soon descends into chaos, as the ancient carousel's parade of beasts comes chillingly to life to deliver the ultimate judgment for their misdeeds. Featuring an original cover of The Rolling Stones' ''Wild Horses'' by Matthew Ryan. A ''vinyl first'' publication, ''Dark Carousel'' will be available exclusively on vinyl prior to any other format.

The OM sound in the mediations mimics long Tibetan horns that produce a deep and rich reverberation, captivating the listener.\n\nThe 1st OM meditation is 10 minutes w/spoken suggestions to relax & and charge you with positive energy. The 2nd is 10 minutes w/o spoken suggestions; the 3rd is 20 minutes w/o voice suggestions. With no spoken transition between tracks, they can link together into a longer meditation, if you choose. There are subtle fade-in/out cues when one meditation track ends and the other begin.\n\nMeditation is simple and doesnt require mysterious Eastern spiritual beliefs or secrets; or sitting in uncomfortable positions. Regular meditation can increase your spiritual awareness if you desire.\n\nMichael Midkiff learned meditation in 1969 as young student in India. Over the years he studied meditation and developed a simple and accessible technique for everyone.\n\nUse this CD in your private space, while riding the subway, waiting in a public area...wherever. Make yourself comfortable and chant aloud or silently feeling the vibration of OM.\n\nDo a 10 meditation before taking a test, giving a presentation, boarding an airplane, when seeking the solution to a problem, during a work break; or even before a round of golf or basketball.\n \nIf youre looking for a fun gift to improve a loved ones life, this is an excellent pick for about the price of a couple gallons of gasoline.\n\nGive yourself permission to RELAX and to SUCCEED!"], "fit": "", "title": "<span class=\"a-size-medium a-color-secondary a-text-normal\"", "also_buy": [], "tech2": "", "brand": "Michael Midkiff", "feature": [], "rank": "2,026,582 in CDs & Vinyl (", "also_view": [], "main_cat": "<img src=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/digital/music/logos/amzn_music_logo_subnav._CB471835632_.png\" class=\"nav-categ-image\" alt=\"Digital Music\"/>", "similar_item": "", "date": "", "price": "", "asin": "0615205399", "imageURL": ["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51mkHVid-xL._SS40_.jpg", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51PeUBsVsYL._SS40_.jpg"], "imageURLHighRes": ["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51mkHVid-xL.jpg", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51PeUBsVsYL.jpg"]},

Using mythic imagination and alchemical notions he reveals how conflicts and oppositions are essential for the ongoing creation of the world as well as for the redemption of the individual. An Eskimo story, The Mistress of Fire, shows how solutions for both personal and cultural struggles depend upon a conscious willingness to sacrifice infantile attitudes that sustain narrow self-interests. Meade shows how received ideas and fixed attitudes restrict and distort our instincts for survival and for shaping vital communities. Beyond that, he redeems the role of pleasure in life and reconnects the flame of libido to its origin in the spiritual realm. Through stories and poems and surprising insights Meade excavates the ground of libido and the realm of the senses to release the vital energies of embodied thought and lunar awareness. In the human crucible made of body and soul Meade finds hidden treasures of imagination and the divine spark of creation.

I didn't realize that sleep can be affected by many circumstances in addition to my To Do list, i.e. food consumption, room temperature, daily schedule, even being lined up with specific points of a compass, etc. The meditation is only 9 minutes long. Short and sweet and it gets the job done...serenity! Sometimes I don't have time for the long audio meditation versions. And by completing this track, I focus on my breath and the serene energy created with Tina's guided imagery and soft music. The hypnotherapy audio is truly awesome. The music, Tina's voice and tempo makes it a sensational experience. You are going to find yourself putting yourself to sleep every night with this track. I even travel with my ipod so I can make sure I have this sleeping aid. I've used the checklist, meditation, and hypnotherapy tracks and I've yet to wake up in the middle of the night.
